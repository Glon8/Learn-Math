# Learn math:

Its my graduation project in Atid college. It ment to be used by pupils and children, to **MAINLY** exercise math, and also learn some cool tricks with.
Build on React-Vite, Mongo Atlas, JS. The site also includes an "online teacher" for kids, which is a Gemini, it very linear toward math,
so if one of the users ll have trouble with excercises, they could ask it about.
Also, since the site is a user friendly, it allows local data savings, which do not requires sign in to the server, but has its own limitations.
The site includes authentication and scores save/share for the authorised users.
The back end, generates exercises, endlessly, by math formulas, and not by premade charts.
