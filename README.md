# Learn math — a full‑stack educational platform

A React‑Vite + MongoDB Atlas project designed for pupils and children to practice math through:

**1. Unlimited, dynamically generated exercises**

* The backend doesn’t rely on static question banks.
* It generates exercises endlessly using mathematical formulas.
* This gives the platform infinite replayability and avoids repetition.

**2. A built‑in “online teacher”**

* Powered by Gemini.
* Focused specifically on math explanations.
* Kids can ask for help when they get stuck — like having a tutor on demand.

**3. Two modes of use**

**Local mode (no login required)**

* Saves progress locally in the browser.
* Great for kids who just want to practice without creating an account.
* Naturally comes with limitations (e.g., no cloud sync).

**Authenticated mode**

* Secure login system.
* Saves scores and progress to the server.
* Allows sharing achievements and tracking improvement over time.

**4. User‑friendly design**

* Built for children — simple, accessible, and engaging.
* Encourages learning without pressure.

**5. Full-stack architecture**

* **Frontend:** React + Vite
* **Backend:** Node/JS
* **Database:** MongoDB Atlas
* **Hosting:** Netlify (frontend), Render (backend)
* **Local dev:**
  * ``npm run dev`` for frontend
  * ``npm test`` for backend
  * Local access at: http://localhost:5174/
